# Fixed candidate for iteration 25

This candidate has ALREADY been decided and implemented. It is the
exact change that was evaluated this iteration. Predict ITS outcome —
do not design a different candidate.

## Candidate
adjacent_archival_merge_1536

## Mechanism
Restore the proven iter_020 stack (multi-signal retrieval, multi-granularity archival indexing, answer-type sentence scoring, tiered compression, simplified formatting) and add two interacting changes:
1. Post-retrieval adjacency merging: archival hits with overlapping or contiguous turn_indices are merged into a single hit before deduplication. This undoes harmful chunking fragmentation and preserves complete conversational threads for aggregation questions.
2. Increase generation budget from 1024 to 1536 tokens to eliminate the empty-output cluster caused by Qwen3 hidden thinking consuming the full budget.
